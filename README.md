# SplitShare

SplitShare is a personal project to attempt to build a web-app with a predominantly Angular frontend and Springboot backend. I wanted to attempt to 
make a social media esque project and gain some experiences with a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

## Tech Stack:
#### Frontend:
- Angular
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS (less)
- Jasmine Testing Suite
#### Backend:
- Spring Boot (Spring Web)
- MongoDB
